TCP protocol can solve all three issue with transmissions 
with a small delay price,
used for data that must arrive correctly and in order 

UDP protocol is used for data that can tolirate some data lost 
such as voice calls, 

these protocols helps :
IP packets arrive in order
Doesnt become damaged or corrupted
doesnt get dropped or lost during transit

Request-response protocol
the clint sends a Request and the web server sends a response

PUT //update
DELETE //remove

path is where the data is stored in the webserver
